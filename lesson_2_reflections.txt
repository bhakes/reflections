Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file folder.
You need to do it before you make any commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers a place to package files into logical segments prior to
committing them. The staging area also show you which files in the
working directory are not a part of the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area can be helpful for staging commits into logical units.
If I have two files that have changed, but I want to make two separate changes
I can log them with two separate commits.
